Read and write raster and vector geospatial datasets straight from [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) with this native asynchrounous [GDAL](http://www.gdal.org/) binding. To get started, browse the [**API Documentation**](https://mmomtchev.github.io/node-gdal-async/classes/gdal.html) or [examples](examples/).

When in doubt on how to use a method, check also the [unit tests](https://github.com/mmomtchev/node-gdal-async/tree/master/test).

# Fork Notes

This project is a fork of <https://github.com/contra/node-gdal-next> which is a fork of <https://github.com/naturalatlas/node-gdal>.

It adds a number of features:

- **Support for asynchronous IO** (since 3.0)
- **Full native TypeScript support** with autocompletion in IDEs that support it (since 3.1)
- **Built-in networking support** with native support for cloud services (since 3.2)
- Support for curve geometries (since 3.1)
- Progress callbacks (since 3.2)
- Numerous bugfixes including a number of memory leaks

The default install is currently the 3.2 branch which is bundled with GDAL 3.2.3.
The 3.3 branch, which introduces a number of significant changes, and is bundled with GDAL 3.3.0, is available only as a git checkout.

Support for `worker_threads` is planned but it is not a priority project

### Breaking Changes relative to node-gdal

- With PROJ 6+, the order of coordinates for EPSG geographic coordinate reference systems is latitude first,
longitude second. If you don't want to make large code changes, you can replace code like `gdal.SpatialReference.fromEPSG(4326)` with `gdal.SpatialReference.fromProj4('+init=epsg:4326')`

### Breaking Changes relative to node-gdal-next

- Starting from 3.2, `gdal.Geometry.fromGeoJson` now throws an `Error` on error instead of simply returning a null geometry

## Installation

Pre-built binaries are provided for most recent Linux distributions, Windows 64 bit and OS X 10.15:

```sh
npm install gdal-async
```

By default all dependencies are the latest versions and bundled out of the box, but if you would like to link against a pre-installed gdal you will have to rebuild it when installing using the following flags:

```sh
# --shared_gdal allows linking to the OS-provided libgdal, requires libgdal-dev (debian: sudo apt-get install libgdal-dev)
$ npm install gdal-next --build-from-source --shared_gdal  
```

## Sample Usage

### Synchronous

#### Raster

```js
const gdal = require("gdal-async")
const dataset = gdal.open("sample.tif")

console.log("number of bands: " + dataset.bands.count())
console.log("width: " + dataset.rasterSize.x)
console.log("height: " + dataset.rasterSize.y)
console.log("geotransform: " + dataset.geoTransform)
console.log("srs: " + (dataset.srs ? dataset.srs.toWKT() : 'null'))
```

#### Vector

```js
const gdal = require("gdal-async")
const dataset = gdal.open("sample.shp")
const layer = dataset.layers.get(0)

console.log("number of features: " + layer.features.count())
console.log("fields: " + layer.fields.getNames())
console.log("extent: " + JSON.stringify(layer.extent))
console.log("srs: " + (layer.srs ? layer.srs.toWKT() : 'null'))
```

### Asynchronous

Mixing of synchronous and asynchronous operations is supported.

#### Safe mixing of asynchronous operations

Simultaneous operations on distinct dataset objects are always safe and can run it parallel.
Simultaneous operations on the same dataset object should be safe too but they won't run in parallel. This is a limitation of GDAL. The only way to have multiple parallel operations on the same file is to use multiple dataset objects. Keep in mind that Node.js/libuv won't be able to detect which async contexts are waiting on each other, so if you launch 16 simultaneous operations on 4 different datasets, there is always a chance that libuv will pick 4 operations on the same dataset to run - which will take all 4 slots on the thread pool. It is recommended to either increase `UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE` or to make sure that every dataset has exactly one operation running at any given time.

**Does not support `worker_threads` yet**

#### With callbacks

If the last argument of an `xxxAsync` function is a callback,
it will be called on completion with standard *(e,r)* semantics

In this case the function will return a resolved *Promise*
```js
const gdal = require('gdal-async')
gdal.openAsync('sample.tif', (e, dataset) => {
    dataset.bands.get(1).pixels.readAsync(0, 0, dataset.rasterSize.x,
        dataset.rasterSize.y, (e, data) => {
        if (e) {
            console.error(e);
            return;
        }
        console.log(data);
    });
});
```

#### With promises

If there is no callback, the function will return a *Promise*

```js
const gdal = require('gdal-async')
gdal.openAsync('sample.tif').then((dataset) => {
    dataset.bands.get(1).pixels.readAsync(0, 0, dataset.rasterSize.x, dataset.rasterSize.y)
        .then((data) => {
            console.log(data);
        }).catch(e => console.error(e));
}).catch(e => console.error(e));
```

### TypeScript (starting from 3.1)

TypeScript support is available beginning with `gdal-async@3.1.0`

```ts
import * as gdal from 'gdal-async'

const ds1: gdal.Dataset = gdal.open('sample.tif')
const ds2: Promise<gdal.Dataset> = gdal.openAsync('sample.tif')
```

### Built-in networking (starting from 3.2)

Built-in networking uses an embedded version of `libcurl`. It supports `zlib` compression through Node.js' own `zlib` support. It does not support `brotli` or `zstd`. Node.js includes `brotli`, but as of Node.js 16 it still does not export these symbols for use by add-ons (yes, go bug them - ask them for c-ares too).
SSL on Linux uses OpenSSL through Node.js' own support. It uses the curl trusted root CA store by default and another store can be provided through the `CURL_CA_BUNDLE` enviornment variable or GDAL config option. SSL on Windows and OSX uses the OS-provided mechanisms - Schannel and SecureTransport respectively - and thus the trusted root CA store will be the one provided by the OS.
